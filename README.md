# Applicant Test

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:

http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg  
http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg  
http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg  

Write a script or program that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images,
storing them on the local hard disk.
Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal day's work: as if this code will be used in
important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.
